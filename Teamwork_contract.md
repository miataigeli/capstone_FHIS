### Teamwork Contract
Note: '@?' means that we may update these points after our first meeting with the mentor
1. We will aim to meet for a daily stand-up on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at least for the first two weeks. We will discuss our progress during these brief meetings and will notify team members of any areas we need help with. Once the project gets going, we might restructure our meeting schedule. We will have a longer meeting after meeting with the capstone partner on Monday to define weekly objectives.
2. We will aim to work on the project for about 40 hours per week each, depending on the amount of work that week. @?
3. As we complete our individual tasks, each team member will write down the tasks they have completed along with the approximate amount of time they spent on it. This will be shared in a Google Sheet, and used for the teamwork evaluation later. 
4. Mia will be the project leader. Her duties will be as follows:
    - writing meeting summaries after meetings
    - keeping note of questions we want to ask the capstone partner
    - writing brief agendas for meetings
    - follow up with each member on the progress of the project as necessary. 
5. We will also keep a project journal in a Google Doc so that everyone is aware of the tasks of the week and the member responsible for the task. Each member will contribute to the journal, and write their tasks for the week after the initial Monday meeting. 
6. We will use individual branches to commit and push our work to the group's GitHub repository. We will synchronize the branches at the end of the week. We will only merge with the master branch when we are sure that our code is correct, and we will have one other person review our code before it is merged. ** Make sure to always pull before we push anything. ** @?
7. Whenever our code needs to interface with someone else's, we should discuss how to best combine our code, and first run it all together on another platform such as Google Colab or DeepNote before pushing it to GitHub. @?
8. We will follow good software engineering practices to make sure that our code is organized and manageable as it grows. This includes:
    - defining classes and functions for things we need to do often
    - creating libraries if needed
    - separating our code into individual .py files
    - @?
9. We will maintain a reference document with useful information about the project, which will be stored in the group repo.
10. Times team members are not available for meetings (including weekends): @?
    - Christina: after 3pm PST
    - Darya: after 6pm PST
    - Mia: before 9am PST
    - Shreyas: before 9am PST
11. Every team member will put all their effort to create the highest quality of work. Team members will review each other's work and help identify typos in text and bugs in code. Team members might help each other edit, or debug their work, to ensure that we are submitting the highest quality of work possible.
12. In order to work well as a team, we would like to eliminate biases in decision making, potential conflicts and promote psychological safety and collective intelligence. We will review these aspects of the team work periodically (weekly / bi-weekly) and discuss how we can work better as a team. Each team member will contribute to this discussion with honesty and respect to help other members to become better team members.
13. The code of conduct below will be followed throughout this project:
    #### **Code of Conduct**
    1. We will not be late to mandatory team meetings (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday). 15+ minutes is not acceptable. Other intermediate meetings are optional.
    2. Response time: We will respond or put a checkmark within 2 hours within work hours or 12 hours outside of work hours. Work/response hours: 9am - 2pm PST. 
    3. Urgent messages: We will write `urgent` in the message, "respond within X please".
    4. If a weekly milestone is incomplete, we should all be online trying to finish it. Preferred deadline: Friday 2pm PST. Emergency deadline: Saturday 12pm PST. 
    5. If stuck on something for more than 4 hours, we will message in Slack and bring it up during a meeting. We will not leave things until Friday.
    6. Work will be divided as equally as possible among group members.
    7. We respect one another's work. If we would like to offer help to another member of the team, we will contact the member privately and offer help. We will not work on another person's responsibility without his / her permission unless the deadline is very close and the person is unavailable. 
    8. In communication, we thank and acknowledge another member's work before we make recommendations to change or to improve. 
    9. Everyone is given an opportunity to speak and explain his / her ideas and opinion. No one will be ignored or excluded in deciding major decisions related to the group project. 
    10. All members should remember to always format and document their code according to the group's standard. Code standard:
        '''
        function_description
        input_var1: (type) description
        input_var2: (type) description
        returns: (type) description
        '''
    11. All members should remember to cite their sources if code is obtained from an external resource.
